   description: Researched on Video Coding for Machines (VCM). Investigated an end-to-end design of the image/video compression codec optimized for a primary learning task (ex- detection) and the re-usability of the optimized codec for other secondary machine learning tasks such as classification and semantic segmentation. For the latter purpose, I proposed pre-trained connectors with  small number of parameters (81 max) to achieves significantly better rate-accuracy performance compared to the conventional codecs optimized for rate-distortion.

intro: |
 I'm a PhD candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering majoring in Signal processing for Image Analysis and minoring in Machine learning at University of California Davis, USA. I obtained my Masters degree in ECE from UC Davis in 2020 and Bachelors degree from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2016 majoring Electronics and Telecommunication.
 
 My research interests align with image/video compression for deep learning, Internet of Things and Information theory. I'm a hiker and a food enthusiast.¬†
